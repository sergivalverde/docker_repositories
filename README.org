* Docker images for medical imaging
Repository of Docker containers for medical image processing :whale::whale::whale:


* Best practices:
- The =/DATA= folder is used as the standard data folder between the host and Docker container.
- The containers are run using the =docker= user (do not use the =root= user). We enforce the =UID= to =1000=.

#+begin_SRC bash
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash -u 1000 docker
#+end_SRC

- Read/write permissions between the host and the container can be handled with the =-u= options by matching the host user's =UID= with the container's =UID=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run -u $UID:1000 whatever/docker/image ....
#+END_SRC

- Installed code inside the docker is placed at =/home/docker/src/=
